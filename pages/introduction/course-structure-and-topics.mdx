# Course Structure and Topics

In this course, we'll dive deep into the fascinating world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), exploring its core concepts, underlying technologies, and real-world applications. The curriculum is designed to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of the DeFi ecosystem, allowing you to navigate this rapidly evolving landscape with confidence.

## Module 1: Blockchain Fundamentals

We'll start by laying the foundation, covering the essential building blocks of blockchain technology. You'll learn about the core principles of blockchain, including cryptography, hashing, and consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. This module will provide you with a solid grasp of the technological underpinnings that enable the DeFi ecosystem.

## Module 2: Ethereum and Smart Contracts

Next, we'll dive into the Ethereum blockchain, the primary platform for DeFi applications. You'll explore the Solidity programming language and learn how to develop robust, secure smart contracts. We'll cover best practices, design patterns, and common pitfalls to ensure you can create DeFi-ready smart contracts.

## Module 3: Decentralized Applications (DApps)

Building on your understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts, we'll delve into the world of decentralized applications (DApps). You'll learn how to design and develop DApps that leverage the power of the Ethereum blockchain, including techniques for interacting with smart contracts and building user-friendly interfaces.

## Module 4: Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

The core of this course focuses on the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. You'll explore the various components of DeFi, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, yield farming, liquidity mining, and stablecoins. We'll discuss the underlying mechanisms, use cases, and challenges associated with each DeFi building block.
